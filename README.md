## ⚠️ Task Instructions (Do Not Treat as Guide)

You have applied for the **DevOps Intern** role.  

Your task:

- Fork this repository.  
- Dockerize this application using **Docker & Docker Compose**  
  - Frontend, Backend, and Database containers  
- Ensure data entered via the frontend is **saved to the database and persists after container restarts**  
- ☁️ **Important:** You must complete this task by deploying the solution on a **cloud server** of your choice — such as **AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  
  - ❌ **Local setup is not allowed**. Your application must be deployed and running in a real cloud environment.  
- 📸 While completing this task, you must **create a detailed SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)** similar to the example provided.  
  - Include **step-by-step commands** you executed.  
  - Add **screenshots of each major step** (e.g., container build, deployment, database verification).  
  - This SOP must **not** be added to your repository.  
- 📨 After completing the task, reply to the **same email** you received this task from and include:  
  - ✅ The **GitHub repository URL** (your forked version)  
  - ✅ A **short paragraph** explaining how you verified data persistence  
  - ✅ The **SOP document as an attachment** (PDF or Markdown)

> 🧠 **Reminder:**  
> - Completing the deployment on a real cloud environment is **mandatory**.  
> - Submissions without a cloud deployment and SOP document will **not be evaluated**.


> This README is a **task only**. It intentionally does not include step-by-step instructions or implementation guidance.
