# DevOps Internship Task â€” Fusionpact DevOps Internship Program 2026

## Task (Do not treat this as a guide)
You have applied for the DevOps intern role. Your task is to:

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. Create **Dockerfile(s)** for the `client` (frontend) and `server` (backend).
3. Create a **docker-compose.yml** that runs three services:
   - `frontend` (React app served from a container)
   - `backend` (Express API)
   - `db` (PostgreSQL) with persistent storage
4. Ensure data entered via the frontend (applicant name, email, note/resume link) is saved to the database and **persists after container restart**.
5. Commit your Dockerfiles and docker-compose.yml to your fork, then **reply to the same email you received this task from** with the link to your forked repository.

**Deliverable:** a link to your forked GitHub repository containing the completed solution and a one-paragraph note describing how you validated that data persisted after restarting containers.
